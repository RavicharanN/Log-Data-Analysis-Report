\begin{abstract}
Massive amount of data is generated by the Openstack cloud services in the format of service logs.
Besides timestamps and log level fields, these logs contain additional information useful for pattern analysis. Unfortunately this information is generally exposed in semi-structured text format, not allowing direct analysis without additional munging of the data. Traditional approaches to extract information from those fields are rule-based, mainly applying regular expressions upon knowledge of the text structure. These approaches require a pre-knowledge of all text patterns and are not scalable with the servicesâ€™ growth. We propose to build a data analytic approach for log data, leveraging the technologies adopted for Web [1] and genomics [2] data mining (such as minhashing [3] and locality-sensitive hashing [4])\LaTeX.
